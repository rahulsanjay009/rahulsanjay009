# 👋 Hi there, I'm Rahul Sanjay Morishetti

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in **San Jose, CA**, specializing in scalable and performant applications across **web**, **cloud**, and **AI**. I bring hands-on experience in building full-stack platforms, intelligent assistants, automation pipelines, and cloud-native applications.

With professional experience at **Amazon** and **NexInfo**, I’ve delivered production-ready software in both enterprise and startup environments. From designing adaptive sales forecasting systems using ML, to crafting real-time inventory management dashboards with React and Django, I thrive at the intersection of problem-solving and engineering excellence.
